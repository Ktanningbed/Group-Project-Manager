Inspiration
--------------

With COVID-19 keeping everyone indoors, teachers and students find it exceptionally difficult to have group projects. With this web-app, I hope to open opportunities for these group projects.

What it does
----------------

This group project manager allows users to create accounts, projects for those accounts, and tasks for each project. Users can add other registered users so that any user added to a particular project is able to add and update tasks.

How it was built
--------------------

This application uses the following tools and languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Node.js (Express)
- MongoDB

Challenges I ran into
-----------------------
Because I wasn't comfortable with using MongoDB, setting up the api so that the React frontend could communicate to the database posed the biggest challenge. This required a lot of research and bug fixing.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
-------------------------------------
- having a better understanding of React components, states, global states (redux)
- creating an api with Express
- creating a full-stack application with a frontend that communicates with a backend database

What I learned
------------------
The MERN stack and various skills to qualify as a full stack developer.
